## How to Play

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Match all 8 pairs of cards within 3 minutes

- To begin, click on a card to flip it over, and try to find its matching pair by clicking on another card

- Do your best to remember the locations of the mismatched pairs as you continue flipping cards

- If you find all the pairs before the time runs out, you win!

- If 3 minutes pass before you match all the pairs, the cards will shuffle, the timer will reset, and you will get another chance

[Good luck!](https://memorymatching.github.io/)
